to fix
done - moving first point breaks transformations
done - moving CP 1 or 3 of a rectangle changes CP 0 -> problem
- some strange output

to add
- curve with paint() by me
- get centre point for each shape
- make centre point moveable and have a 'reset centre point' button

done
- control points should be transformed and then added to the item
- transformations should: cut excisting transformations, apply new, apply exciting
